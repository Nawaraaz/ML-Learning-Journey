machine Learning models only understands numbers not the string so at first we have to convert the value into the encoded form to make operation fast

e.g if we have to predicit car model sales based on the model and the fuel type that what we going to do
data {
    car_Brand = BMW, Audi, Tesla
    fuel_type = petrol, Diesel, Electricity
}
the system dont understand what it means it have to convert it into encoded form

BMW =0
Tesla =1
Audi= 2
or
BMW= [1,0,0]
Audi = [0,1,0]
Tesla = [0,0,1]

Label encoding: Replacing each catagory represented in text form into numeric
e.g
gender  encoded
male     0
female   1     # it is like yes or no
