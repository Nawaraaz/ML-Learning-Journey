project title: Calculator with history

what i am going to build : A calculator that can be able to perform calculations of arthimetic operations and show the calculations history

how will the program work: user will input the arthimetic operator in the terminal as given along with numbers and the results will be displayed

features: can look calculations history
          can clear the history
          can clear the operations
          can clear the whole equations and program

concepts and their need in program

input: to get user input
functions: to organize code
conditions: to decide what to do
file handling: to save/ load/ clear history in a .txt file
loops: to keep the program running until user exits
basic maths: for calculations


psudocode:
1. start the program
2. define the name of history file
3. loop forever(while true):
   a. ask user to enter a calculation
   b. if user enters exit:
      i. print a goodbye message
      ii. break the loop
    c. if users enters history :
       i. try to open the history file
       ii. if file exits and not empty, print each line
       iii. If file doesnot exists or is empty, print no history found
       iv. continue to the next loop
    d. if users enters clear:
       i. open the history file and empty it
       ii. print history cleared
       iii. continue to the next loop

    e. otherwise
       i. try to praise the input to get the numbers and the operator
       ii. if input is not valid, print invalid input and continue
       iii. perform the calculation using if/elif
       iv. show the result to the user
       v. write the calculation and result to the result to the history file

    f. End the program
