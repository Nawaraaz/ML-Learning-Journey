Project idea: Fake news headline generator

what are we going to build: fake and funny headline creater

how the program work: steps
                     1) subject {who or what}
                     2) Actions 
                     3) places/objects
The user will input subject

concepts used: 
lists : to store the group of words like names actions places

random.choice(): to pick one item randomly from a list

print(): to show the fake headline on screen

input(): to ask user if they want another headline

while loop : to repeat the process untill the user says no

strings concatenation or f-strings: to form sentence using selected words


        : steps
           1) import random module
           2) create list of subjects, actiions, and places all with examples
           3) use random.choice() to pick one word from each list
           4) combine the words into a headline using string formatting
           5) print the headline to the user
           6) Ask the user if they want another headline
           7) If yes repeat; if no stop the program
